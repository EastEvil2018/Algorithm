# Algorithm

Hello guys, this is my own algorithm project which I want to store my solutions on some interesting interview problems.

Since this is my own tool for debuging my code in local, this project is built to let me more conveniently do algorithms.

For each problem I have recorded in this repo, I implement them as a 'Solution' class, say 'SubStringSolution', and When you want to run the solution, just use sol.run(), and it will output problem Descriptions + Testing Process + Explainations.

For example usage, see Analyzer.java.

The original purpose for this project is for me to do algo more clearly, and manage each problem in a pretty good structure, welcome to see my solutions in the different themes folder and feel free to write your comments!
