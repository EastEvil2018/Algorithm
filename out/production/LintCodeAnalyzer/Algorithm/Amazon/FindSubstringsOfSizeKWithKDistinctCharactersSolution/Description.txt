Michelle has created a word game for her students. The word game begins with Michelle writing a string and a number, K, on the board. The students have to ﬁnd the substrings of size K with K distinct characters.

Write an algorithm to help the students ﬁnd the correct answer. If the given string does not have K distinct characters then output an empty list.
Input
The input to the function/method consists of two arguments -
inputStr , representing the string written by the teacher;
num , an integer representing the number, K, written by the teacher on the board.

Output
Return distinct substrings of input string of size K with K distinct characters.

Constraints
0 ≤ num ≤ 26

Note

The input string consists of only lowercase letters of the English alphabet. Substrings are not necessarily distinct.

Examples
Input:
inputStr = awaglknagawunagwkwagl
num = 4

Output:
{wagl, aglk, glkn, lkna, knag, gawu, awun, wuna, unag, nagw, agwk, kwag}

Explanation:
Substrings in order are: wagl, aglk, glkn, lkna, knag, gawu, awun, wuna, unag, nagw, agwk, kwag, wagl
“wagl” is repeated twice, but is included in the output once.
