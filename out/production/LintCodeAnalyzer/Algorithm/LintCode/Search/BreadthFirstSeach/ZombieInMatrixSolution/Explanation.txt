Explanation :

Special BFS Solution.

For example.

given :

0 1 2 0 0
1 0 0 2 1
0 1 0 0 0

After first day

1 1 2 0 1

1 1 0 2 1

1 1 1 0 1

Second day :

1 1 2 1 1

1 1 1 2 1

1 1 1 1 1

So for each day, we need to iterate each node, if it is '1', we bfs it for only ONE level.

For each while loop, days++.

And remember to use visited array to remember which '1' is visited before, e.g, changed by some '1' before at

the cur Loop.

And to check if the array can not be all zombies.
