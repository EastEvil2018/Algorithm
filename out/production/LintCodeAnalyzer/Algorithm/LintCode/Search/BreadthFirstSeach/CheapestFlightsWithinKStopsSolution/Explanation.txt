Explanation :

The Flights given can create a graph.

How to represent this graph?

Well for each city, we create a list of the flights from it.

And create a directed graph.

Then we use BFS.

And we can filter lots of nodes using recording minPrice.

The first price is recorded.

In the after, all the prices > current minPrice nodes will be casted.

So reduce the time complexity, otherwise it will cause time limit.
