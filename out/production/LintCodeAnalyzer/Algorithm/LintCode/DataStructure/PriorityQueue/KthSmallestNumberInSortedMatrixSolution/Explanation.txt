Explanation :

Well, the interesting things is the challenge for time complexity.

O(k log n) time where n is the bigger one between row size and column size.

Which we can both scan matrix from col or from row.

Since it is a matrix, rowSize == colSize, it works, just take care of col and row in Pack.

And take care of deep copy!
