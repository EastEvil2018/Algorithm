Explanation :

The first solution is brute-force.

Let us assume N is the total number of integers.

K is the number of arrays.

Create a N-size PriorityQueue.

And insert all the numbers into it, then poll all them,

But this is O(NlogN).

What about the challenge?

Well, it time-complexity is O(NlogK), K is the number of arrays.

So we should create a K-size PriorityQueue, then do poll() N times.

That is, always keep the head element of arrays in the PriorityQueue,

Then after poll() it, insert into the next element of array.
