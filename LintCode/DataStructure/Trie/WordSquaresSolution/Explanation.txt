Explanation :

For this problem, we need to use prefix tree and dfs
Why we use prefix tree?
Because when we insert word into squares, for example,
The result is [b a l l]
              [a r e a]
What is the next word prefix? we can decide the first 2 char right?
Follow the rule, the first 2 char of the third word is "l e"
So for ith row, we just need to the append all the ith char from the previous
words, and use it as a prefix to search in the prefix tree, then we get all the
candidates, then dfs, problem sovled.
