Explanation :

The difficulty here, is the frequency is dynamically, not given.

So how to update the dynamically frequency.

The priorityqueue can not hold on.

What we do now is construct a Comparator in TreeSet.

we us hashMap to compare each words when adding for frequency,

And add into treeset, if the set size > k, then we remove the last one.

Which is the least frequent one.

Now we are done.
