Explanation :

We use PriorityQueue to do this problem.

First think about the rule of priority in this problem.

First, compare the frequency of word appearance.

So we need to remember the frequency of each word, how to?

HashMap<String, Integer>.

Then, if frequency is the same, compares the strings.

So we both need a word and frequency in one data object.

So we need to create a new class includes both word and frequency.

Then we create a new Comparator to compare.

Then we construct the priority queue, poll the top k words, done.
