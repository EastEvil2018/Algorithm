Description :

Since the given array size N is much larger than K,

The best solution is to keep a K-Size priorityQueue, which takes O(NlogK) time.

Just to keep the queue in k size, execute poll() after add element to it when size > k.

And to find the Kth largest, we need to keep the queue in ascending order,

to ensure each poll() element is the smallest one in the current queue.
