Explanation :

For Example, n = 28, str = "111097654281222131272625242321320191817161514";

For each recursion, we should iterate from index 0 to 1.

Take the number as substring(0, 1) or (0, 2).

But we need to take care of some special cases;

1. the num is more than n.

2. the num is 0.

3. the substring starts from 0.

4. the num has already been added before.

And also, take care of the string length for each iteration, sometimes its length is 1,

So we do not need to substring it at (0, 2).
