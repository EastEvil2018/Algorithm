Explanation :

Using Recursive function, we can split the whole process to subtasks.

For example, if we want to do a problem of 3.

First, move 2 from A to B

Second, move the last one from A to C

Third, move 2 from B to A

That is

move(2, A, B, C)

move(1, A, C, B)

move(2, B, A, C)

For n problem

move(n - 1, A, B, C)

move(1, A, C, B)

move(n - 1, B, A, C)
