Explanation :


This solution is to calculate all the permutations

But it wll have duplicate number.

In the traditional dfs solution.

For example, [1, 2, 2]

Let me draw the dfs tree.

                0
        1       2       2

    12 12     22 21   21 22

    122 122   221 212  212 221

Actually we only need 122, 221, 212

how to avoid duplicates?

Well, if we can sort the arrays, and add some checks for dfs.

That is , for the cur recursion, we don't need to recurse on the number which the previous one is the same and the previous one has been recursed.

that is a[i] == a[i - 1] and a[i - 1] is not visited(which means already dfs back)
