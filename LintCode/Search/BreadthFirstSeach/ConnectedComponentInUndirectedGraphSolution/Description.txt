Description :

Find the number connected component in the undirected graph.

Each node in the graph contains a label and a list of its neighbors.

(a connected component (or just component) of an undirected graph

is a subgraph in which any two vertices are connected to each other by paths,

and which is connected to no additional vertices in the supergraph.)
