Explanation :

BFS :

Make some changes to BFS, since the ball can rolling up as the direction,

for each level, we need to continuously add move to each ball until it hits border or wall.

Then add to queue.

And remember to add a visited array.

If you create a custom Node class, it will cause space limit.


DFS :

For each possible path, dfs it to see if it is possible, if it is, return true.
