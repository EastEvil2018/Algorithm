Explanation :

To solve this problem, let us first come up with brute-force dfs.

That is, calculate all the combinations of k integers from given nums.

And check if the sum of the list is target.

But obviously, this solution will waste a lot of resource.

so we can add a check for target here, and we sort the nums array first.

So for each recursion, if the nums[startIndex] > target, break, we do not

need to recurse it.

That saves a lot of time.

And remember, for combination problems, we need to add startIndex,

otherwise will have duplicates problems.
